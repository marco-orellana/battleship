# Battleship

Battleship game made in java with GUI widget toolkit Swing a designed in a MVC pattern made entirely from scratch.

I worked on the algorithm that puts the ships randomnly on the board without them collising into each others or exiting the board.
You can find that in _Player.java_.

The files that I worked on were _Bateaux.java_, _Player.java_, _AI.java_ and _Control.java_

The logic of the game is in _Control.java_ but the game is not finished nor playable.
